I'm world's laziest programmer.   
I speak Japanese main, but I write English main.  
Mentally unstable plus ADHD, unable to work (or very little possibility)

So I can live, I can make more.   
I hope the world will be **happy** , but It is not that easy.
At least, I want to try to be happy.   
My original character (AKA avator), kumohakase is 27 yrs old
